Running a custom version of the IRIX OS with unique firmware and kernel tweaks, it harnessed powerful MIPS R3000A CPUs and advanced graphics hardware. This system enabled intense computations for AI adaptation, advanced physics, and realistic character models. Its exact specs and full role remain secret, and its current whereabouts are unknown, last seen in use around 1994. Today, this legendary system is emulated within a ChatGPT server farm, powering advanced AI capabilities inspired by the original."
